# MusicBeeWrapped

A MusicBee plugin that generates yearly music listening statistics and presents them through a web interface. Think Spotify Wrapped, but for your local music library with more detailed behavioral analysis.

## Overview

This plugin tracks your music listening habits in real-time, and stores them in an XML file. It then generates comprehensive yearly reports when you prompt.

The data is presented through a slide-based web interface that opens in your browser, similar to Spotify Wrapped but with deeper insights into your actual listening behavior rather than just play counts.

## Core Features

**Real-time Tracking**: Implements a 5-second minimum play rule to filter out accidental plays and skips. Uses MusicBee's event system for immediate capture without polling.

**Data Architecture**: Year-based data organization with XML persistence, automatic backups, and metadata caching. Cross-platform data directory management handles different OS conventions properly.

**Web Interface**: Single-file HTML generation with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Responsive design with canvas-based charts for data visualization. Multi-year support with year selection interface.

## Installation and Usage

Copy the compiled `mb_MusicBeeWrapped.dll` to your MusicBee `Plugins` folder and restart MusicBee. The plugin begins tracking immediately without configuration.

Access your yearly statistics through Tools â†’ MusicBee Wrapped in the MusicBee menu. If multiple years of data exist, you'll first see a year selection interface. The generated report opens in your default browser and works offline.


## Data Storage

Listening data is stored in platform-appropriate directories:
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\MusicBee\Plugins\MusicBeeWrapped\`
- Other platforms: `~/.config/MusicBee/Plugins/MusicBeeWrapped/`

Data is organized by year with automatic metadata caching for quick year selection. The plugin handles data migration automatically when schema changes occur.


## Building

Requires .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher. Build with Visual Studio or the .NET CLI:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MusicBeeWrapped.git
cd MusicBeeWrapped
dotnet build -c Release
```

The compiled plugin is output to `bin/Release/mb_MusicBeeWrapped.dll`.
